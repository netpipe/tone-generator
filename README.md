tone generators for sdl, qt , and openal

I find 10,000 hz interesting for tininitus relief and other brain modes. ( be aware frequency's can make you feel ill possibly sicken you)

there are movies like THX for inspiration(brain lock tones) also pyramids themselfs make noises around 20k hz so humans themselfs might be adept at working with high frequency's already.


10750 sounds same as 10k
10100 nice feel to it
10800 seems to be muscle relaxing
9800 some find soothing

./qt/ folder has the more complete working example "cmake ." to build or make a .pro file for it
